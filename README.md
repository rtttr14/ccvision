Here’s your idea rewritten in “professional imbecile” style (jargon-heavy, overblown, corporate-academic tone, but saying the same thing):

Conceptual Framework: Recursive Self-Similarity Pattern Expansion Algorithm (R-SSPEA™)

The core principle is the exploitation of local chromatic homogeneity for feature-space propagation. Starting from a stochastically sampled origin pixel (assumed to reside within dermal-tonality regions), the algorithm initiates orthogonal expansion along adjacent vectors. Expansion is iteratively continued through a recursive self-similar pixel matching function until a discontinuity in the color manifold is encountered (e.g., transition to high-contrast absorptive spectra—commonly observed in hair regions).

This naive propagation can be significantly augmented through integration with adaptive machine learning heuristics. For instance, incorporating bilateral facial symmetry constraints allows the system to extrapolate mirrored structural patterns: if a periocular formation is detected on one side, the algorithm probabilistically anticipates a homologous structure on the contralateral side, thereby reinforcing detection fidelity and envelope closure accuracy.
