concept. self-similar pattern search. imagine skin and hair. take random pixel, suppose it's on skin, expand it orthogonally with function that expands on similar colored pixels (self-similar pattern search). now go on expanding until algorithm sees different pattern/color in our case, black if it's hair. saf. improve it with maching learning and symmetry, like structures expands and if it sees eye, then it should see self-similar eye on other side of face to envelope in same way - this is improves that algorithm really hard. saf.
